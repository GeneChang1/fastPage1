            "content": "Collaboration Quiz . Score:3/3This quiz was interesting, but easy. The last question I wasn&#39;t sure on because it was correct on a technicality but I did get it right. While users could help identify errors they made, the couldn&#39;t fix it. . Program Function and Purpose Quiz . Score:6/6This was the hardest quiz for sure. The fifth question had some code that was pretty difficult to understand but once I realized how ti worked it was pretty cool. Also in general the code language is a little weird. The way they set variables and print stuff. It seems like they changed a lot of stuff just for the sake of changing it and in turn made it worse. Overall though it was still easy. . Program Design and Development Quiz . Score:3/3This quiz was pretty easy overall. The only thing that I was confused on is that indexes for collegeboard start at 1. This means that arrays start at 1 and not zero so one question about switching the valuesin an array was a little weird. .",

What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} menu2 = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 more = 1 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) total = menu.get(item) while more == 1: item = input(&quot;more?

What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding.

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string name = &quot;Gene Chang&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 16 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 2147000000.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[0]&quot;, langs[3], type(langs[0])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name Gene Chang &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 16 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 2147000000.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[0] Bash &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Gene Chang&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;score&#39;: 2147000000.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] Gene Chang &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Nathaniel&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Capule&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;July 8&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Del Sur&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;nathancapule13@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2008 BMW 328i&quot;] }) InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Toby&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Leeder&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;March 10&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;4s Ranch&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;tobyzeavleeder@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;None&quot;] }) InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Gene&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Chang&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;February 19&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Del Sur&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;genechang0219@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;None&quot;] }) def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) print() def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() def backwards_while_loop(): print(&quot;Backwards Time n&quot;) i = 4 while 0 &lt; i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i -= 1 return backwards_while_loop() .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Gene Morbius Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 1732 BC Cars: N, o, n, e . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Gene Morbius Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 1732 BC Cars: N, o, n, e . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . score = [] scoresDict = {16:10, &quot;Gene&quot;:20, &quot;San Diego&quot;:30} for keys in scoresDict.keys(): answer1 = input(&quot;How old is Gene?&quot;) if answer1 == 16: score.append(scoresDict[16]) else: print(&quot;Incorrect!&quot;) answer2 = input(&quot;What is Gene&#39;s Name?&quot;) if answer2 == &quot;Gene&quot;: score.append(scoresDict[&quot;Gene&quot;]) else: print(&quot;Incorrect!&quot;) answer3 = input(&quot;Where does Gene live?&quot;) if answer3 == &quot;San Diego&quot;: score.append(scoresDict[&quot;San Diego&quot;]) else: print(&quot;Incorrect!&quot;) print(&quot;Your score is&quot;, sum(score)) . Incorrect! Incorrect! Incorrect! Incorrect! Incorrect! Incorrect! Incorrect! Your score is 50 . Hacks .

Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | Could you create new or add to dictionary data set?

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.
