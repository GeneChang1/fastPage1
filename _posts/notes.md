- The process is similar to our own 
    - Commericalizing product 
    - Roles in team 
    - Trying to get what customers want 
    - Design phase
    - Release

### ALl
- Working to help customers lives and create new technology

## Kris 
- Works in SRE, DevOps, Infrastructure 
- Took a bunch of math/physics classes in high school
- Went to UCLA for electrical engineering for bachelors and masters
  - Allowed him to go into his first CS class but didn't do so well
- Did research in the internet of things in undergraduate and graduate
  - Embedded Networked Sensors to get biological reading with AI
  - Caused him to learn about linux which is good
- Graduated from Grad School but nobody was hiring due to economic depression :(
- Took many different jobs until reaching an email marketing automation start
  - First big experience with devops and redunancy/security 
  - Then worked at NBCUniversal with their first streaming platform
- Also worked with some geofencing on phones to see if they are near stores
  - After company wasn't doing well, moved over to qualcomm with a lot of devops
- Two years ago started working in twitter which is really big tech with a huge site and graphql
  - Got services and information from users & got extensive training
  - At there he did continious learning which is key to always be learning new thing
- Worked on streaming, analytics, financial systems/banking, twitter data centers, graphql component of the data center. 
  - All helped people visualize and understand data about the
  - Rest API to graphql 
- Soon going to start working at a Web3 infrastructure company
- For doing AI tensorflow and ai is used
- In twitter used custom web frameworks as well as monorepo which combines everything in one repo

## Q & A
- Do you have any experience with agile methodology?
  - Technically, different companies have their own versions of "agile"
  - There is organization in order to coordinate all the employees to reach goals
  - "Sprints" are a key concept to do things in 1-3 months vs 6-12 months
- Do you still work at Twitter (Kris)?
  - No, moved on but looked for jobs as soon as Twitter acquisition possible
  - Good decision as whenever mergers or acquisitions happen layoffs are possible
- How do you think AI can be used?
  - Can be used to predict when to turn off servers or when demand will be low
  - Key to see where the customers are and predict what to sell
- What are important skills to have in the tech industry?
  - Two important skills that are continous learning (learn how to learn), don't be scared of risk/take advantage of learning opportunity
  - Other skills is to be adaptable to whatever jobs or what life throws at you, and being able to listen/to translate to technology/speeaking to non technical people
- How do interviews work?
  - They give you a short time to code something and it should compile with no errors
  - Use your negotiating leverage in the fact that tech companies are in demand (a lot of companies force you to work a lot but be careful so you don't get exploited)
- How are you judged in the professional scene? 
  - Judged for explaining process and problem solving 
  - Ex. "How many tennis balls in the United States?", what is your thought process
- What are you planning on doing in the future? 
  - Blockchain technology, AWS, companies with their own data centers 
- How does coding help with investment and finance? 
  - Machine learning and data storage to better service people 
  - Stocks and automated options for finance.
